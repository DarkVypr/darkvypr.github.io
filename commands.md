| vb ocr `DIRECT_LINK_TO_IMAGE` `LANG_CODE`| Get the text out of an image. <br /> <br /> The image you send must be mostly text. Images and art confuses the OCR API and will likely not give a result. If you don't get a result, try colouring over the images with a black brush in Paint or covering them up with something. <br /> <br /> Use The following language codes to specify the language of text in an image: <br /> <br /> Arabic = `ara` <br /> Bulgarian = `bul` <br /> Chinese(Simplified) = `chs` <br /> Chinese(Traditional) = `cht` <br /> Croatian = `hrv` <br /> Czech = `cze` <br /> Danish = `dan` <br /> Dutch = `dut` <br /> Finnish = `fin` <br /> French = `fre` <br /> German = `ger` <br /> Greek = `gre` <br /> Hungarian = `hun` <br /> Korean = `kor` <br /> Italian = `ita` <br /> Japanese = `jpn` <br /> Polish = `pol` <br /> Portuguese = `por` <br /> Russian = `rus` <br /> Slovenian = `slv` <br /> Spanish = `spa` <br /> Swedish = `swe` <br /> Turkish = `tur` <br /> <br /> This would mean that saying: `!ocr https://i.imgur.com/O6yJV4b.png jpn` would return `こんにちは` or "hello" in Japanese. The `jpn` after the URL indicates that the language in the image is Japanese. If you put an image that has any non-english text, it will return an incorrect or blank result. If you are using !ocr with english text, you do not need to specify the language, it will default to english.
